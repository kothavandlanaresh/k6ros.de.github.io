    <h1>Nonlinear Analysis in FEM</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Nonlinear analysis in FEM is used to model problems where the relationship between forces and displacements is not linear. This includes large deformations, nonlinear material behavior, and contact problems.</p>

    <h2>Types of Nonlinearities</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Geometric Nonlinearity:</strong> Occurs when deformations are large enough to affect the structure's stiffness. The equilibrium equations need to account for changes in the geometry.</li>
        <li><strong>Material Nonlinearity:</strong> Arises when the material's stress-strain relationship is nonlinear. Examples include plasticity and hyperelasticity.</li>
        <li><strong>Contact Nonlinearity:</strong> Occurs in problems where elements come into contact with each other, affecting the overall behavior.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Example: Nonlinear Material Behavior</h2>
    <p>For a material that follows a bilinear stress-strain curve, the stress-strain relationship is:</p>
    <div class="formula">
        <pre>
        σ = E1 * ε  for ε < εy
        σ = E1 * εy + E2 * (ε - εy)  for ε ≥ εy
        </pre>
    </div>
    <p>Where σ is the stress, ε is the strain, E1 is the initial modulus, E2 is the modulus after yielding, and εy is the strain at yield.</p>

    <h2>Solution Techniques</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Incremental Loading:</strong> Apply loads in increments and solve the problem at each step.</li>
        <li><strong>Newton-Raphson Method:</strong> An iterative method used to solve nonlinear equations by linearizing the problem at each iteration.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>Nonlinear analysis is essential for accurately modeling complex behaviors in structural and mechanical systems where linear assumptions are insufficient.</p>
