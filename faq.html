        <h2>What is Finite Element Method (FEM)?</h2>
        <p>Finite Element Method (FEM) is a numerical technique for finding approximate solutions to boundary value problems for partial differential equations. It breaks down a large system into smaller, simpler parts called finite elements.</p>
